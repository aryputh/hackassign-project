## HackAssign
This hackassign project utilizes c#, Judge0, supabase, and other elements to build a website that allows teachers to come together and configure coding problems in an environment where the student can compile and post code all in the same space. The user will be able to log in as either a teacher or student which depending on their role, will have access to different features on the dashboard such as assignment creation, submissions, and class management.
