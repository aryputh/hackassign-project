## What's New (User Facing)
 * Users can create an account and login to the site.
 * Instructors can manage classes by adding/removing students, and editing, deleting, and creating classes.
 * Instructors can manage assignments by editing, creating, and deleting them.
 * Users can navigate from their dashboard to various pages (i.e. classes or assignments).

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We setup the foundations for our application by importing packages and linking them to properly communicate with one another. Three major components were required to make the application operational; creating the website UI, setting up databases to store user and assignment information, and a compiler for code to be run on. Carsyn was tasked with handling UI elements in the React app, Aryan built the databases utilizing Supabase, and James setup the Judge0 compiler. The difficulty of the project stemmed from working with an externally hosted app. Our team was very cautious regarding making changes to the main site, therefore many of the changes were tested on our local machines when possible. Given that these packages are new to our team, our changes would often be sent to Aryan to verify their functionality, as his work was geared towards linking up with the main website. In future sprints, we would like to continue the work in an incremental fashion, as many of these packages involved performing a lot of setup for a single contribution, and ideally the project should be built slowly over time with its features for manageability.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
