# Sprint 2 Report 
Video Link: INSERT
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Compiling of programs
 * Checking against test cases
 * Small styling issue fixes

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we successfully integrated the Judge0 compiler API, allowing users to execute and evaluate code submissions within the platform. We also introduced a dynamic language selection feature, enabling users to pick their programming language. Additionally, we improved test case management by enforcing role-based permissions for instructors and enhanced UI responsiveness. Another major milestone was displaying Judge0â€™s runtime environment, which provides users with clear execution steps. Several bugs were addressed, including fixing the test case refresh issue and refining role-based access control. Overall, this sprint was a success, and we are prepared for the next sprint!

## Unfinished Work
We were able to finish everything we wanted to for the second sprint.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
 * [US03-1 Add test cases to assignments](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/issues/19)
 * [US03-3 Display Judge0 Runtime Environment on Main App](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/issues/9)
 * [Add Dropdown Menu for Changing Programming Language](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/issues/33)
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
  Every issue we set out to complete was done by the end of sprint 2.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:
 * [Dashboard.js](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js)
 * [AssignmentPage.js](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/AssignmentPage.js)
 * [TestCasePopup.js](https://github.com/aryputh/hackassign-project/blob/main/frontend/src/components/TestCasePopup.js)
 
## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
 * Adding Compiler API
    * Implementing the compiler API was a significant milestone. The integration of Judge0 allowed us to execute and evaluate code submissions dynamically. This feature enables real-time code execution, helping users test their solutions without leaving the platform.
 * Allowing Users to Choose Their Language
    * Giving users the ability to select a programming language was crucial for flexibility. This feature ensures that users can work in their preferred language when solving assignments or running test cases.
 * Displaying Judge0 Runtime Environment in the Main App
    * Providing visibility into the runtime environment helps users understand execution constraints and metrics.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
 * More Robust Error Handling in the Compiler API
    * While the API integration is functional, error handling can be improved to cover edge cases like timeouts, syntax errors, and large inputs/outputs.
 * Enhancing UI for Language Selection
    * Currently, the language selection dropdown works but could be more intuitive.
    * Adding tooltips for supported languages
    * Displaying a default language based on past selections
    * Improving mobile responsiveness
 * Performance Optimization for Code Execution
    * As more users interact with the platform, performance optimizations are needed.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Fully implement Judge0 compiling and results
   * Analytics at different levels
   * Fully styled system
